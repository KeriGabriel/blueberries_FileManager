Questions for Dan:  
	When we received the filepath input, does that include the file name or just the path to the directory?

To Do:

	Unit Testing - stub for testing each function is in, need to add code for each test


//These are the things we need to query the file stream for - grabe them all at once?

object FileObject {		
	string FileName;
	string FilePath;
	int Size;
	}


Implement Blueberry Methods or Variables?

		bool FileExists(filepath) {}
		ourBerry.Get(FileExists);

		GetDirectoryName(_filepath)
		ourBerry.Get(DirectoryName);
			variable:  string DirectoryName

		string DirectoryName(filepath)
		
		string LargestFileInCurrentDirectory(filepath)
			if a tie is found, first one alpha sorted

		string VowelWeight(filepath) 
			Format: 12 Es, 1 A, 4 Is, 6 Os, 2 Us, 0Ys 
			return all zeros if file supplied has no txt extension

		string FileName

		string FileExtension(filepath)
		
		byte[] GetByteArray(filepath)

		string ToString()
			returns a string concatenation of:
				string FilePath
				long Size
				bool ReadOnly  (This will need to be collected when we gather sizes)
				DateTime DateChanges	(Can we restrict this to date only?)



Done:

	Shell program to call each function is set in Harness project as the startup
